# Instagram Gallery Angular App

This repo is from a course on building multiple pages in Angular. It was
supposed to load all of the most popular images from Instagram into a bootstrap
gallery layout so that a user could scroll through them.  However Instagram
has changed their API since this video was released so it now requires a valid
callback URL to get a client access token instead of just using the client_id
code as before.

I decided to go ahead and finish the entire repo per the video even if the full
functionality wasn't there just to get experience in the coding of the new
service and seeing how the lightbox was setup.
